In the project, exploratory data analysis of spotify dataset from Kaggle is performed in a Jupyter notebook using Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib libraries. 
Three different classifiers are built namely decision tree classifier using scikit learn, random forest classifier using scikit learn, artificial neural network based classifier using Keras 
The performance of the classification algorithms are analysed.
